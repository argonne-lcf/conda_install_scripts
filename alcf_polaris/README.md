# To do
- [ ] Migrate away from `/soft/datascience/conda/2022-07-19-login`
- [ ] Monitor fix to `umask` being messed up on compute nodes
- [ ] Fix and validate PyTorch+Hvd script with >1 nodes https://github.com/argonne-lcf/dlSoftwareTests/blob/main/pytorch/horovod_mnist.qsub.polaris.sh on Polaris. Works fine on ThetaGPU 2 nodes
- [ ] Confirm PyTorch DDP functionality and performance with Corey
- [ ] Re-check NCCL performnace with Denis once the GPUDirect issues are resolved: https://cels-anl.slack.com/archives/C03G5PHHF7V/p1658946362840349
- [x] Get copies of old, pre-AT Tcl Cray PE modulefiles for reference. Not possible, since they are not cached in `/lus/swift/pAT/soft/modulefiles`, but are part of the compute image in `/opt/cray/pe/lmod/modulefiles/core/PrgEnv-nvidia` e.g. 
  - [ ] Understand `nvidia_already_loaded` etc. from https://cels-anl.slack.com/archives/GN23NRCHM/p1653506105162759?thread_ts=1653504764.783399&cid=GN23NRCHM
- [ ] Monitor fix to new Cray `cudatoolkit-standalone/11.4.4` etc. Lua modulefiles whereby `#include <cuda_runtime.h>` is not found by the compiler. https://cels-anl.slack.com/archives/GN23NRCHM/p1658958235623699
- [ ] Get fix for `PrgEnv-gnu` failure building TF from source:
```
/opt/cray/pe/gcc/11.2.0/bin/redirect: line 5: /opt/cray/pe/gcc/11.2.0/bin/../snos/bin/redirect: No such file or directory
```
